// Does the storage layer actually stop an application inventing a destination?
//
// The behaviour under test is not "does place() return a string". It is that a
// Ref carries NO path an application can concatenate, so the line that caused
// all of this —
//
//     std::string partial_path = output_path + ".partial";
//
// has nothing to be written against. Most of that guarantee is enforced by the
// compiler and cannot be asserted at runtime; what this file checks is the part
// that can be: the two-phase commit, that a placed blob is not findable until it
// is committed, and that digests are compared by meaning rather than spelling.

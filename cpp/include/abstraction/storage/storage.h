// storage — where bytes live, addressed by what they are rather than by what
// somebody decided to call them.
//
// This is the C++ side of the abstraction the Go package implements. As with
// job, the two are not ports of one another: they agree about the layout on
// disk and about what an operation MEANS, and each API looks like its own
// language.
//
// # The problem, measured rather than assumed
//
// One ordinary machine, four tools, four stores that know nothing about each
// other:
//
//     LM Studio          44 GB   names files by filename only   NOT dedupable
//     Lemonade           26 GB   content hash
//     Ollama             23 GB   content hash
//     HuggingFace cache  23 GB   content hash
//
// 116 GB, with the same weights in more than one of them under different names.
// Not because the problem is hard — because there is no shared interface.
//
// # Why this exists in C++ specifically, and what it is meant to break
//
// The download layer was adopted here and the storage layer was not, and the
// consequence was not theoretical. Lemonade builds its own destinations:
//
//     std::string partial_path = output_path + ".partial";
//
// nineteen times in model_manager.cpp alone. It then hands those strings DOWN
// into a download spec — so the application tells the abstraction where bytes
// go, which is the defect at the other end of the same call the download layer
// was supposed to fix. Everything downstream follows: code that scans for
// `.partial` files, code that deletes them, code that skips them when listing
// models. A delete raced a supervisor that owned the very bytes it was removing,
// and only a Windows file lock turned silent corruption into an error message.
//
// None of that could be caught by review, because there was nothing to catch it
// WITH: no C++ type existed that an application could be required to hold
// instead of a path. That is what this header is. A Ref carries no path a caller
// can concatenate, so the line above stops compiling rather than stops working.
//
// # What this must not become
//
// Not a filesystem. A Ref is opaque, and a store that happens to be a directory
// says so through the Local capability rather than by returning paths from the
// interface — the same shape job::LocalStore has, for the same reason: the
// binding must not be able to name itself upward.
